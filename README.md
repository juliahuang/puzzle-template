## Setup
To run, you'll need to have node and npm installed. I'll leave that up to your googling abilities to figure that out :). Then, go into the directory and install the node packages.
```
cd puzzle-template
npm install
```
Then, you can run the app:
```
npm start
```
If you navigate to localhost:3000 , you should be able to see the example puzzle :)

## Editing
The only files you should need to change are:
- src/puzzle.css (for your css)
- src/puzzle.js (for your puzzle! more guides in the actual file)
